      <h2>Need help?</h2>

      <p>You can use our new <a target="_blank" href="http://groups.google.com/group/padrino">Padrino Google Group</a> or send us an <a target="_blank" href="mailto:padrinorb@gmail.com">email</a> or write a <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/padrino">message</a> also directly to our <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/padrino/following">team</a>. Also, be sure to join our official <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel at <a target="_blank" href="irc://chat.freenode.net/#padrino">#padrino</a> on <a target="_blank" href="http://freenode.net">freenode</a> for live help.</p>


      <h2>Find a bug?</h2>

      <p>Log it onto github by <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/issues">creating a new issue</a>. Be sure to include all relevant information, like the versions of Padrino and Ruby you are using. A <a target="_blank" href="http://gist.github.com/">gist</a> of the code that caused the issue as well as any error messages are also very helpful.</p>
      <a name="want-to-integrate-a-component">&nbsp;</a>
      <h2>Want to integrate a component?</h2>
      <p>Have a particular javascript engine you like? Know of a popular orm or testing framework that we have overlooked in Padrino generators? We encourage you to contribute by creating a patch to integrate your favorite components into Padrino! Check out the guide for <a href="http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/adding-new-components">adding new components</a> to read a detailed walkthrough of how to do this!</p>


      <h2>Want to help with documentation?</h2>

      <p>The process for contributing to Padrino’s website or documentation is as simple as forking the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-docs">docs repository</a> and sending in any changes as a pull request. Once a change has been accepted, the documentation will be updated on our website. The website guides and docs are currently in the <a target="_blank" href="http://textile.thresholdstate.com">textile</a> format as can be seen for the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-docs/blob/master/guides/getting-started.textile">Getting Started</a> guide on Github.</p>

      <p>There is also important <span class="caps">YARD</span> documentation within the framework code itself which could always use improvements. An example is the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/blob/master/padrino-helpers/lib/padrino-helpers/asset_tag_helpers.rb">asset tag</a> helpers file which is marked up with <span class="caps">YARD</span> annotations for every object and method.</p>

      <p>Be sure to read over the <a target="_blank" href="http://rubydoc.info/docs/yard/file/docs/GettingStarted.md"><span class="caps">YARD</span> Getting Started</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://rubydoc.info/docs/yard/file/docs/Tags.md">Tag Overview</a> guides for more details on this syntax. Every component of Padrino should be documented with <span class="caps">YARD</span> annotations which will be generated periodically to our <a href="http://www.padrinorb.com/api/Padrino/Helpers/AssetTagHelpers.html">official api</a> documentation page.</p>

      <p>You can also contact us for access to modifying the pages and guides within our site directly once you have had a patch accepted. Simply email <a target="_blank" href="mailto:padrinorb@gmail.com">padrinorb@gmail.com<script type="text/javascript">
      /* &lt;![CDATA[ */
      (function(){try{var s,a,i,j,r,c,l,b=document.getElementsByTagName("script");l=b[b.length-1].previousSibling;a=l.getAttribute('data-cfemail');if(a){s='';r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16);for(j=2;a.length-j;j+=2){c=parseInt(a.substr(j,2),16)^r;s+=String.fromCharCode(c);}s=document.createTextNode(s);l.parentNode.replaceChild(s,l);}}catch(e){}})();
      /* ]]&gt; */
      </script></a> and request access.</p>


      <h2>Code Guidelines</h2>

      <p>Padrino core contributors also have several code guidelines and conventions that we try and keep consistent within our codebase. We try to follow the common <a target="_blank" href="http://pathfindersoftware.com/2008/10/elements-of-ruby-style">Ruby code guidelines</a> such as two space soft tab indentations, and we also like to keep a newline at the end of every ruby file.</p>
      <p>Another convention to keep in mind is to minimize all trailing and unnecessary whitespace. If you are using TextMate, be sure to check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/glennr/uber-glory-tmbundle">uberglory</a> which will automatically keep your code and spacing clean.</p>


      <h2>Have a patch?</h2>

      <p>Bugs and feature requests that include patches are much more likely to get attention. Here are some guidelines that will help ensure your patch can be applied as quickly as possible:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Use <a target="_blank" href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>: The easiest way to get setup is to fork the <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework">padrino repo</a>. Or, post a comment, if the patch is doc related.</li>
      <li>Write unit tests: If you add or modify functionality, it must include unit tests. If you don’t write tests, we have to, and this can hold up acceptance of the patch.</li>
      <li>Mind the <span class="caps">README</span>: If the patch adds or modifies a major feature, modify the <span class="caps">README</span>.rdoc file to reflect that. Again, if you don’t update the <span class="caps">README</span>, we have to, and this holds up acceptance.</li>
      <li>Push it: Once you’re ready, push your changes to a topic branch and add a note to the ticket with the <span class="caps">URL</span> to your branch. Or, say something like, “you can find the patch on johndoe/foobranch”.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><b><span class="caps">NOTE</span>:</b> we will take whatever we can get. If you prefer to attach diffs in emails to the mailing list, that’s fine; but do know that someone will need to take the diff through the process described above and this can hold things up considerably.</p>


      <h2>Looking for something to do?</h2>

      <p>If you’d like to help out but aren’t sure how, take a look at the <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/issues">GitHub Issues</a> page. If you find something that looks interesting, leave a comment on the ticket noting that you’re investigating (a simple “Taking…” is fine). Once you’ve worked on a few issues, someone will add you as an assignee.</p>
